It's been two weeks since we started trading paper money in the US stock market. I should say that all the trainings that I have attended are now paying off. I just wish that my performance will be good enough for the prop firm to consider me as one of their live traders. You see, this is just a part-time gig. I still have my not-so-boring 9am-6pm day job as a programmer.

As of last Friday, here are my stats computed by my trading journal in [Tradervue](https://www.tradervue.com/).

I still have a long way to go, but I really think I found the trading strategy that works well with my personality.

A big factor in my winning trades is the fact that I use the right set of tools. I consider myself pretty resourceful. If I can get it for free, better. If not, I'll look for the cheapest alternative. With these tools I'm able to plan my entry orders with the proper risk/reward ratio.

- [FINVIZ.com — Stock Screener](http://finviz.com/)  
  I use this [custom screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=110&s=n_majornews&f=cap_midover,sh_curvol_o2000,sh_price_o10,sh_relvol_o1,ta_averagetruerange_o1&o=-volume&ar=180) with the following filters:  

  Signal: Major News  
  Market Cap: +Mid (over $2bln)  
  Price: Over $10  
  Average True Range: Over 1  
  Relative Volume: Over 1  
  Current Volume: Over 2M

  The only drawback is that the screener is delayed for 15 minutes. The $24.95 Elite subscription is too expensive for me. During my shift, I look for potential trade setups with the stocks that appear in my scanner.  

- [TradingView — free stock charts and quotes online](https://tradingview.com/)

  I'm using the PRO Plus Account with exchange subscriptions in NYSE and NASDAQ. One of the cool feature is that I'm able to see extended hours market data.  Here's a snapshot of my charts. I use the VWAP, 9-20-200 EMAs as my indicators and the Daily, 15-5-1 minute time frames.
